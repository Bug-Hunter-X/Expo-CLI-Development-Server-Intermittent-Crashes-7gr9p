While working on an Expo project, I encountered an issue where the development server would intermittently fail to start or would crash after a few minutes.  The error messages were inconsistent and unhelpful, varying between generic network errors and seemingly random JavaScript exceptions. This happened across multiple platforms (iOS simulator, Android emulator, and physical devices).  The project itself built successfully, but the development server was unreliable, making development extremely frustrating.
